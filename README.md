# Advanced Financial Data & Portfolio Risk Analysis

Professional Python-based dashboard for portfolio performance evaluation,
risk metrics, and stress testing, designed for real-world financial
decision making.

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end financial analysis dashboard built in Python
to evaluate portfolio performance, risk exposure, and stress scenarios.
It focuses on clarity, robustness, and interpretability rather than black-box models.

professional-grade analytical tool and portfolio showcase.

- Risk metrics (volatility, drawdowns, risk indicators)
- Stress testing and scenario analysis
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Modular and readable Python codebase
- Designed for real financial workflows, not toy examples

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
